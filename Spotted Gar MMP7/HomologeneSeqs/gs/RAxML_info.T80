IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 16NP_005932.2_Homo_sapiens and 16XP_001136497.1_Pan_troglodytes are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 16NP_005932.2_Homo_sapiens and XP_001084206.1_Macaca_mulatta are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file strippedalign80.phy.reduced
